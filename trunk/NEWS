   if with '~^', to the first of the files with duplicate basename;
   if with '~$', to the last of the files with duplicate basename.

   font magnification. If FACTOR is positive this value will be hardcoded. 
# (r945)
   If FACTOR is negative, the magnification factor in the _fbfont_magnify_factor
   variable will be used, with -FACTOR as default.
   If FACTOR is 0 a default of 1 will apply.
   Option meant to be used with with very high resolutions and small fonts.
 * configure --with-font-magnifying-factor=0 will enable runtime control of the
   text magnification factor via variable _fbfont_magnify_factor .
