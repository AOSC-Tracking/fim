## <a id="1overview"></a>[	1		Overview](#1overview) ##
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIM (Fbi IMproved) is a highly customizable and scriptable image viewer targeted
at the users who are comfortable with software like the Vim text editor or the
Mutt mail user agent, or keyboard oriented, full screen programs.
FIM aims to be a "Swiss Army knife" for viewing images.

FIM is multidevice: it has X support (via the SDL library), it supports
ASCII art output (via the aalib and libcaca libraries), and because it derives
from the Fbi image viewer (by Gerd Hoffmann), it can display images in the Linux
framebuffer console, too.

FIM is free software, distributed under the terms of the GPL software license.


## <a id="2description"></a>[	2		Description](#2description) ##
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIM invocation is documented in `man fim` (/#man_fim).
The FIM language (syntax, commands, variables, key bindings) is documented in
 `man fimrc` (/#man_fimrc).

FIM offers many ways for scaling, orienting, listing or rearranging the
ordering of images.
FIM is capable of regular expressions based (on filename) vim-like autocommands,
comment-based search and filtering, display of EXIF tags, customizable command
lines, and use a custom font (from console fonts).
FIM offers GNU `readline` command line autocompletion and history,
completely customizable key bindings, internal/external scriptability
(through return codes, standard input/output, commands given at invocation time,
 and an initialization file), internal filename-based image search, and more.
Each documentation item is accessible via the internal `help` command.


## <a id="3features-comparison-to-other-image-viewers"></a>[	3		Features, comparison to other image viewers](#3features-comparison-to-other-image-viewers) ##
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

 * modes: interactive (default), and command line
 * lots of the functionality is scripted in an internal domain specific language
 * on-screen debug and information console in command mode
 * per-image variables (e.g.: `i:var="value"`)
 * regular expression filename search (`/*.png`) and view
 * command line history (enter the console with `':'`, then use arrows)
 * command line Tab-based command autocompletion (thanks to the GNU readline)
 * command line history file save/load support (`~/.fim_history`)
 * key-action bindings, with Shift (uppercase and Control ('C-') key combinations
 * simple `if/while` scriptability, with integer/float/string variables and arithmetic evaluation
 * command aliases support (macros)
 * event autocommands (styled after Vim's `autocmd` )
 * regular expressions on filenames to enrich autocommand behaviour
 * image descriptions display ('expando' sequences)
 * regular expressions on image descriptions
 * configuration (initialization) file support (`~/.fimrc`)
 * usable built-in default configuration
 * wrapper script (`fimgs`) to convert pdf,ps,eps,dvi,cbr(rar),cbz(zip),tar,tar.gz,tgz,http://...
   contents into images that can be displayed
 * embedded piping through `convert`,`inkscape`,`xcftopnm`,`dia`... to visualize further file formats
 * view a Matrix Market file rendering via librsb
 * index-based `goto` styled after Vim (`:<number>`)
 * image search with regular expressions on filenames (`goto` command)
 * other stuff   usual for an image viewer (`scale`, `pan,` etc..)
 * other stuff unusual for an image viewer (setting scale factor, auto width scale,
   auto height scale, marking of 'interesting' files, sorting of files in the
   list, recording/replaying of sessions, repeat last action )
 * image flip, mirror, rotation, stretch (asymmetric scaling)
 * command iteration (with the `[n]<command key>` syntax
 * external script file execution
 * system call support
 * image cache and mipmaps
 * image prefetch
 * pipe commands from an input program
 * many features could be enabled or disabled at compile time editing the Makefile
 * run under screen or ssh
 * read files list via standard input
 * read image file via standard input
 * read commands script via standard input
 * support for SDLlib (Simple Directmedia Layer) (`-o sdl`) (X!)
 * support for AAlib (ASCII Art rendering) (`-o aa`)
 * support for libcaca (Colour ASCII Art rendering) (`-o ca`)
 * experimental (incomplete, discouraged) support for Imlib2 (`-o imlib2`) (X!)
 * experimental support for file formats: PDF, PS, DJVU
 * view any file as a binary/RGB pixelmap
 * view any file as (rendered) text
 * open files at a specified byte offset
 * image list limiting (temporary list shrinking)
 * comments / captions / description files
 * search and reordering based on descriptions and internal variables
 * decode files based on magic number (contents), not file extension
 * recursive load from directory
 * sort files list on file name, file size or name date
 * text font control (selection of size and consolefont)
 * dump list of selected images to `stdout`
 * jump between last two images repeatedly with one key

 The next table is a comparison (very outdated...) of popular image viewers 
 available on Linux, focusing on FIM-like free software ones.

 Libraries originally required by Fbi-1.31 but not by FIM:
 	libFS, libCURL, libLIRC


Usually, building and installing FIM proceeds like:

	./configure --help # get options you may pass to configure
	./configure
	make
	make test
	sudo make install

If you wish to run `./configure` again with different options, it is
recommended to `make clean` before that.

## <a id="41test"></a>[	4.1		Test](#41test) ##

 
	# run fim in interactive mode (press q to quit)
	make test

	# run the test suite
	make tests


You can also run separately parts of `make tests`:

	# run only -o fbdev tests (if disabled, fail)
	make fbtests

	# run only -o sdl tests (if disabled, fail)
	make sdltests

	# run only -o aa tests (if disabled, fail)

## <a id="5run-time-requirements"></a>[	5		Run time requirements](#5run-time-requirements) ##
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Linux (not sure if it is necessary for it to be an x86; i think not)
 * The framebuffer device ( e.g.: `/dev/fb0` or `/dev/fb/0` ) enabled in the kernel
   ( and usually found in `"/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb"` in the kernel source
    code tree ).
 * unless disabled, FIM will create a history (`~/.fim_history`) file in the
    `${HOME}` directory when leaving (so it assumes ${HOME} to exist)
 * shared library files for e.g.: libpng, libjpeg, libgif, libtiff, libreadline,
   libexif, ...


## <a id="6original-idea"></a>[	6		Original Idea](#6original-idea) ##
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIM derives from the wonderful fbi-1.31, written by Gerd Hoffmann/Knorr:
 ( Fbi can be obtained at https://www.kraxel.org/blog/linux/fbida/ ).

It all started in 2005, developing a small 'vim-like fbi patch', and following
features to enrich Fbi with a command line and more customizations.

FIM is a significant reorganization and expansion of the Fbi code, and aims at
obtaining the most scriptable and configurable image viewer ever.


## <a id="7notes-for-patch-writers"></a>[	7		Notes for patch writers](#7notes-for-patch-writers) ##
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run, FIM requires a Linux box with X, or the framebuffer device enabled in
the kernel, and some popular image file decoding libraries.

Information about the framebuffer can be found under the directory
 "./Documentation/fb"
 inside the kernel tree 
 (usually "/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb" ).

The file decoding libraries are listed in an earlier section.
Tested and working with library SDL-1.2.12 through SDL-1.2.15.
Experimental support for SDL-2.0.

From the original Fbi README, it reads that Gerd himself built FBI hacking
"a svgalib PhotoCD viewer", so regard this software as a big, dirty code
potpourri :) .
For the sake of completeness, FIM started as a fork of version 1.31 of fbi,
available from http://dl.bytesex.org/releases/fbida/fbi_1.31.tar.gz .

Useful documents I've read and consulted during the coding of Fim, and 
useful for hacking it:

 * other ones, but non documented here.


 If you intend to write patches or contribute to the code, be sure of reading 
 all of the documentation and _write me an email first_ (I will give you some
 advice).

## <a id="71hacking-maintenance-guidelines"></a>[	7.1		Hacking, maintenance guidelines](#71hacking-maintenance-guidelines) ##

If you hack FIM in an interesting way, consider submitting your changes as a
patch.

 * If you introduce support for a new file format: `fim -V` should list the
   your new format, too (so you should update it).
 * Same for a new output device.
 * FIM should continue passing the tests after your patch, and your patch should
   be robust, too. Consider writing a new test case.

 You should find fim in Debian and Ubuntu, and install it with:

	sudo apt install fim

 But beware: the deb packages may be outdated.
 

 In order to build from repository, you are advised to install packages from
 the following (overly complete) list:
  
 autoconf autoconf-archive autoheader automake autotools-dev bison ctags
 flex groff g++ libaa1-dev libcaca-dev libdjvulibre-dev libgif4 libgif-dev
 libjpeg-dev libncurses5-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libexif-dev
 libpoppler-cpp-dev libpoppler-dev libpoppler-private-dev libreadline-dev 
 libsdl2-dev libspectre-dev libtool m4 make svn txt2html

 The above list was valid on a Debian Jessie installation; it's possible that
 these packages names change with time.
