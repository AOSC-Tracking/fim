 * configure --with-font-magnifying-factor=FACTOR controls text magnification by an integer factor.
   If FACTOR is positive, this value is hardcoded and cannot be changed at runtime.

   If FACTOR is 0 (default) a default of 1 applies, and can be changed at runtime.
   This option is meant to be used on configurations with high resolutions and small consolefonts.
