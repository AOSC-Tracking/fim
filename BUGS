==== BUG REPORTING
For sending a bug report, please frop me an email with a subject line beginning with 'FIM : '.
Contact information is in the doc/FIM.TXT file.

Please DO NOT dare sending bug reportings about installation unless you have read the INSTALL
file and you are sure all the dependencies on your system have been resolved.

For example  "FIM : problems with resolution 457x3778" would be a good, informative 
subject for me.

When submitting a bug report, please follow the following rules:

 - be as much informative as possible when describing yout experience.
 - make a report about the current environment:
   ( make;make report ) | gzip  > fim.`date +%Y%m%d%H%M`.log.gz
  and send me the created .tgz file
 - please give me information about the exact way you experienced the problem
 - please send me the config.log file, too.
   it is of vital importance!
   the config.log file is created by the configure script when you run the ./configure script
 - if you are using an ad hoc method for installing (say, the ebuild for the Gentoo Linux ),
   consider sending the logfile created and named in the error messages.

==== CONTACT
You can mail your report to dezperado_FOobAr_autistici_Baz_org, by replacing _FOobAr_
with a '@' and _Baz_ with a '.'.
