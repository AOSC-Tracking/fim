==== BUG REPORTING

For sending a bug report, please drop me an email with a subject line beginning with '[FIM]'.
Contact information is in the doc/FIM.TXT file, or in the bottom of this file.

Please DO NOT dare sending bug reports about installation unless you have read the INSTALL
file and you are sure all the dependencies on your system have been resolved.

For example  "[FIM] problems with resolution 457x3778" would be a good, informative 
subject for me.

When submitting a bug report, please follow the following rules:

 - be as much informative as possible when describing your experience.
 - make a report about the current environment:
   ( make ; make report ) 2>&1 | gzip  > fim.`date +%Y%m%d%H%M`.log.gz
  and send me the created .tgz file
 - please give me information about the exact way you experienced the problem
 - please give me information about the resolution you are running on
 - please send me the config.log file, too (especially if it is a build bug).
   it is of vital importance!
   (the config.log file is created by the configure script when you run the ./configure script)
 - if you are using an ad hoc method for installing (say, the ebuild for the Gentoo Linux ),
   consider sending the logfile created and named in the error messages.


==== CORE DEBUGGING

 Consider debugging with gdb or letting me do this for you!
 by running

	$ ulimit  -S -c unlimited

 before Fim, in the case Fim should crash, it will generate a file called 'core'.
 That file, if sent to me (but contact me before sending, because it could be big!),
 will be helpful for debugging Fim and discover the causes of the crash.

 p.s.: please compile the code configuring in this way:
 ( use ./configure --help='-O0 -ggdb' ) 
 and don't forget to send me the executable file, too :)

==== CONTACT

You can mail your report to dezperado_FOobAr_autistici_Baz_org, by replacing _FOobAr_
with a '@' and _Baz_ with a '.'.

==== ISSUES UNDER REWORK

20080220	the string operators and generally the Fim language are under rework

==== KNOWN ISSUES

20080127	Under screen, Fim behaves well but it doesn't handle well console switching:
		after a console switch, it doesn't redraw the image if not triggered to do so.

20080106	keys 'Insert,Cancel,Home,End' are not recognized in the commandline mode.
		This issue will be fixed after the fbi core will be cleaned up and revised.
20071005	flex-2.5.4 is known to have problems. flex-2.5.4a is known as a patched version of it
20070811	On CENTOS 64 bit, i reported linking problems : -ltermcap is required, too.
		I Don't know exactly how to fix this issue.
2007*		Bugs shared with fbi:
		- do not switch console or interrupt the program while it is busy: it could hang your console
		  and force you to make tricks to get back the terminal (like typing blindly through consoles,
		  or trying to get to some X instance via ALT-F7-like sequences, or even restart the computer),
		  and blind typing could be dangerous, if you do now know what you are doing!

==== FIXED FBI/FBGS BUGS

 Original typo in fbgsh :  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3119 fixed following the 
 patch indicated on http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141684 :

	-gs     -dSAVER -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH
	+gs     -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH

 It could let a PostScript file execute evil code, according to the advisory.

==== KNOWN BUGS

Please refer to the documentation (doc/FIM.TXT) for the rest of known bugs (BUGS section).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Never, for ANY reason, press C-z (^Z) with the intention of putting fim in
   the background. It will blind your console and allow only for blind
   typing, which is a very dangerous situation! (bug shared with fbi)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


==== FLEAS

20080317	--disable-windows is broken and deprecated
20071006	namespace stuff is still in embryo phase. lots of bugs will arise soon :)
20070921	the autoskip failed images mechanism is buggy
20070920	system(...) is VERY UNSAFE : an image named $( rm .. ) could cause a disaster :)
20070919	while command suffers from being not interruptible in some cases (when the image is small and not 'panable')
20070912	Debugging it with the framebuffer under gdb hangs the console (even with -p).
20070904	problems could occur with the commands giving output when no std::cout << "" is returned soon after (see Commandconsole.cpp mehods for this..)
20070811	The automake required for autogen.sh'in this package is 1.10.
		So users who want to build from the svn repository are required to use this version.
20071128	tried:
	Linux host 2.6.19-gentoo-r5 #1 SMP Mon Sep 24 15:08:36 CEST 2007 ppc 7447A, altivec supported PowerBook5,4 GNU/Linux
	and gave problems with the PAGE_MASK macro, originally in /linux/include/asm-i386/page.h :)

==== CHOICES

20070920	single windowing mode (FIM_WINDOWS) is mandatory now
