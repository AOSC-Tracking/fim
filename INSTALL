====== INSTALLATION

To build Fim, type 'make' in its source directory, once expanded the archive.

Then use 'make install' as root :

# su 
Password:
# make install
checking for libdir name ... lib
install -d /usr/local/bin
install -s fim /usr/local/bin
install ./src/fbgs.sh /usr/local/bin/fimgs
install -d /usr/local/share/man/man1
install -m 644 doc/fim.man /usr/local/share/man/man1/fim.1
install -d /usr/local/share/doc/fim
install -m 644 doc/FIM.TXT /usr/local/share/doc/fim/
install -m 644 doc/FIM.html /usr/local/share/doc/fim/

or

# su -c 'make install'
Password:
checking for libdir name ... lib
install -d /usr/local/bin
install -s fim /usr/local/bin
...

to install the fim executable, the fim wrapper script (fimgs), the fim man page,
and documentation in the dedicated directories in /usr/local.

====== INSTALLATION BUG REPORTING

If something goes wrong, please email me the output of 'make report', or the .tgz
file resulting from the following statement execution:

 ( make;make report ) | gzip  > fim.`date +%Y%m%d%H%M`.log.gz

Have fun!

====== FRAMEBUFFER PROBLEMS

p.s.: if you do not even know if you have the framebuffer or it is correctly configured,
there is a section of the doc/FIM.TXT file dedicated to this, and the same information in
the man page.

Consider reading it!

====== DEPENDENCIES

p.p.s.: consider that to build Fim, you need the following programs installed:

 flex	(the lexer generator)
 bison	(the parser generator)
 gcc	(the C compiler)
 g++	(the C++ compiler)

and some libraries, like libjpg, libpng, libgif, libtiff, libreadline.

All of these programs are probably already on your system, and if not, your system will
 probably give a way to install them (apt-get on debian, emerge on gentoo.. ).

====== DEPENDENCIES : example on Gentoo

On a Gentoo system, you should resolve dependencies running as root:

# emerge media-libs/libpng media-libs/jpeg media-libs/tiff media-libs/giflib sys-libs/readline

And install the essential developer tools flex and bison:

# emerge sys-devel/flex sys-devel/bison

====== TODO

A gift in form of a well written gentoo/debian/other distribution dependency file
would be much appreciated.

Suggestions are welcome, too!
