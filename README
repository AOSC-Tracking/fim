		FIM - Fbi IMproved (alpha) README document.
================================================================================
			Overview
================================================================================

FIM aims to be a highly customizable and scriptable image
 viewer targeted at the users who are confortable with software
 like the Vim text editor or the Mutt mail user agent.

It is based on the Fbi image viewer, by Gerd Knorr, and works in the 
 framebuffer console (so, not in X mode).

================================================================================
			Features
================================================================================

Implemented features: 

 - interactive vs command mode
 - on-screen debug console in command mode
 - command line autocompletion (thanks to the readline)
 - key-action binding, with shift and control combinations
 - command aliases support
 - simple if-while scriptability, with integer variables and arithmetic evaluation
 - event autocommands (in vim style)
 - configuration (initialization) file support
 - wrapper script to convert pdf,ps,eps,dvi,cbr(rar),cbz(zip) contents into images
   and display with FIM
 - regular expressions to enrich autocommand behaviour

Working on features : 

 - decent (auto)documentation, in gdb style!
 - regular expressions to restrict the image selection

Future features :

 - mutt-like hooks (vs autocommands)
 - mutt-like patterns ~p, ~r ...
 - advanced pattern selection of images on other criterias
 - quick goto command
 - system(), exec() and pipe  support (and the dangers it brings...)

================================================================================
			Compilation Requirements
================================================================================

 - fbi, with curl and exif support disabled
 - the GNU readline library
 - flex and bison (not any lex and yacc)
 - the GCC, of course
 - the libraries required by FBI

================================================================================
			Run Time Requirements
================================================================================

 - A Linux box
 - The framebuffer console 
 - the libraries required by FBI

================================================================================
			Technical overview
================================================================================

Its architecture is based on the wonderful fbi-1.31, written by Gerd Knorr:
 ( fbi can be obtained at http://linux.bytesex.org/fbida/ ).

An idea of the concept was settled when developing a small 'vim-like fbi patch'
for fbi back in 2005/2007:
http://dezperado.altervista.org/coding.html#vim-like-fbi,%20and%20the%20wrapper%20fbgs.sh%20script%20modified%20for%20handling%20of%20ps,dvi%20and%20pdf%20files

The code is applied as a patch to the existing fbi source tree.

FIM is developed as a C/C++ soup, and to compile requires:

 - fbi, with curl and exif support disabled
 - the GNU readline library
 - flex and bison (not any lex and yacc)
 - the GCC, of course

To run it requires a Linux box with the framebuffer device enabled in the kernel.
Information about the framebuffer can be found under the directory
 "./Documentation/fb"
 inside the kernel tree 
 (usually "/usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb" ).


From the original README, it reads that Gerd himself built FBI hacking
"a svgalib PhotoCD viewer", so regard this software as a big, dirty code
ball :) .



Useful documents I read during the coding of this patch:

- Thomas Niemann's tutorial to yacc & lex
- The yacc & lex HOWTO
- GNU readline manual
- Ray Lischner, STL Pocket Reference, O'Reilly, 2004 
man console_codes
man fb.modes

 - 2.6.17 Linux Kernel, GCC-3.3.6, flex 2.5.4, bison 1.875d, gentoo
