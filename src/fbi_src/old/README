This is a image viewer for framebuffer devices.
It is quick & dirty hacked off a svgalib PhotoCD
viewer.  This background is the reason for a few
limits:

  * It can handle the usual VGA graphics modes
    only, i.e. packed pixels with 8 bpp pseudocolor
    and 16/24/32 bpp truecolor/directcolor
  * It was designed to handle photos.  It can display
    paletted images (i.e. GIF) too, but not very well.
    On 8 bit displays you'll get dithered images...

It has PhotoCD, jpeg, ppm, gif, tiff, xwd, bmp and png support
buildin.  Unknown formats are piped throuth convert (ImageMagick),
which hopefully can handle it...

If you run it with -h, it will print a short description.
I've tested this on i386 (matroxfb) and ppc (atyfb).

Changes are listed in debian/changelog.

Have fun,

  Gerd
