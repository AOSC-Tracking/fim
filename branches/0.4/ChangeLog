	  notes

2011-07-12 09:14  dezperado

	* the previous fix was flawed, too, so we restrict the Esc based
	  approach to sdl only.

2011-07-12 08:44  dezperado

	* workaround to the ESC inconvenience in non-sdl mode: one may
	  press the ESC key twice (introduced a trivial state machine).

2011-07-12 07:59  dezperado

	* the previos esc-exits-readline change introduced a problem: in
	  framebuffer mode, arrows (among others) are emitted as sequence
	  of keys, the first of which is the ESC char. therefore the arrows
	  did emit an ESC key, exiting the command line.
	  fixing limiting the esc-exits-readline do SDL mode only.

	  sequences of input chars, but this is a major feature.
	  changed the order in the THANKS file.

	  hardcoded fimrc will accept backslashes (although the language
	  has still some problems with them).
	  changelog update.
	  doc fix.

	* introduced two variables to control djvu,pdf,ps rendering dpi as
	  well as bit-based image width.
