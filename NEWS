In detail, in no particular order:

 * Experimental support for SDL2.
 * More responsive readline mode.
 * Switch --resolution 'fullscreen' appends 'W' if in SDL mode.
 * If a "matrix market" file is loaded, its rows, columns and nnz are image variables, too.
 * Introduce special 'early' form  -C =var=val  where variable var is assigned to unquoted and non-interpreted value val immediately.
 * Fix: --cd-and-readdir was not jumping back to first file.
 * Fix: --device option not ignored anymore.
 * Rename --no-etc-rc-file switch to --no-etc-fimrc-file .
 * fimgs: bunzip2, wget, and xz are now optional.
 * Bugfix: fimgs to properly remove temporary directory after loading downloaded files.
 * Misc small improvements in documentation text output and reporting (no cursor in post-search output line; misc messages).
 * Key 'Z' now assigned to 'sleep 1'.
 * Key 'Del' now assigned to 'list "remove"'.
 * Add -= as short form of the --no-auto-scale option.
 * Experimental: add command "crop", also activated after selecting the area by holding Shift and clicking with left mouse button (if running with -o sdl).
 * Add command "pan 'vsteps%' 'hsteps%'" and "'pan 'vsteps' 'hsteps'".
 * Keys F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,F10,F11,F12 are now usable with 'bind' with modes -o aa, -o ca, -o dumb.
 * Fix for -o sdl: when flipped or mirrored, it used to draw a smaller box by mistake.
 * Only filenames matching "^[/A-Za-z0-9_.][/A-Za-z0-9_.-]*$" can occur in a conversion command involving an external program.
 * --pread-cmd=command  substitutes any occurrence of '{}' in command with the actual filename, executes the result and reads an image from its stdout.
 * -o fb=S will not tolerate running under screen.
 * Bugfix in --script-from-stdin now prevents possible crashes.
 * Removed configure options --enable-c++11 -- use CXXFLAGS instead.
 * Bugfix: 'autocmd_del' with no arguments would crash.
 * Bugfix: autocommand "PostHardcodedConfigLoading" now triggers even if --disable-fimrc .

 * Add command 'stderr', similar to 'stdout'.
 * This is the last FIM version supporting the C++03 standard.
 * Refresh configure and Makefile templates.
 * Build fixes for the MinGW environment.
 * man fim: improve manual contents (on ~/.fim_history, individual options, wording, etc.).
 * man fimrc: added a section with default aliases,
 * Where appropriate, 'make tests' uses 'timeout' to prevent possible hangs.
 * Switch  -K <chars>  aka  --chars-press <chars> simulates input of characters at startup.
 * Fix: slideshow function (e.g. `fim --slideshow=5 media/`) will now cycle forever, unless --once/-1 option specified (as in fbi).
 * Fix: after 'quit' no command shall execute anymore (unless in -F).
 * With SDL one can specify window size as percentage of allowed size (-o sdl=w55%), or draw a help grid map (-o sdl=h).
 * With SDL (-o sdl), center window by default.
 * Fix: now pressing keys "1n1n" will not execute 'n' 11 times, but twice.
 * configure --enable-debug is a developer option now.
 * libcaca (-o ca) mode is now complete and is the default ASCII Art mode.
 * Slideshow function (e.g `fim --slideshow=5 *.jpg`) now more responsive.
 * Arrow keys are now working in aalib (-o aa).
 * Bugfix with aalib (-o aa): don't truncate long lines.
 * Avoid memory leak in language parser.
 * Avoid console buffer memory corruption.
 * Eliminate a memory leak from file loading code. 
 * Eliminate memory leaks in PNG, JPG, TIFF, EXIF, and font decoding code.
 * Fix possibly broken `make -j` in rebuilding fimgs.man and fimrc.man.
 * Correct configure script check for regcomp() -- could lead to false negatives.
 * Don't break build on missing 'gs'.
 * Experimental: use --load-shadow-directory <dir> to add a "shadow directory".
   Then 'scale "shadow"' (bound to key '"') will substitute the current displayed image
   with that of the first same-named file located under a shadow directory.
 * When loading a directory, regular expression from default "_pushdir_re" variable now matches filenames with .webp extension.
 * Fix: `fim -c '/<pattern>'` was broken.
 * Add " INTEGER , INTEGER IDENTIFIER arguments" syntax to repeat a command 
   on each file in the interval and substitute its name to '{}' in the arguments
   to an iterated command IDENTIFIER.
 * If a key is bound to e.g. 'goto "+1F"', keep pressing it to accelerate (not if e.g. "+1f").
 * Internal fix: piping from external commands was using 0 instead of 'WNOHANG', leading to hanging.
 * Internal fix: error handling was missing.
 * fimgs now to handle tar.xz archives.
 * Reload automatically image on file change.
 * Command 'list' 'sort_var' 'var' to sort file list according to values of 'i:var'.
 * Command 'list' 'sort_comment' to sort file list according to 'i:_comment' value.
 * Add a --verbose-font-load switch to set '_fbfont_verbosity=1'.
 * Variable '_fbfont_verbosity' sets verbose font loading.
 * Fix: short options -b, -h, -R were not getting optional argument (e.g. -b1).
 * Key combination C-r now assigned to "reload ''".
 * Fix: symbol from fbi sources clashed with gcc-6 onwards, breaking compilation.
 * Key combination C-w assigned to setting auto-scaling to width.
 * Smoother scroll of large images.
 * If SSH_TTY set and no output device specified, give precedence to aalib, then libcaca.
 * Bugfix: in --as-text will avoid repeated reload of file.
 * Hardcoded font (if configured in) will serve as fallback font.
 * Add a --no-pipe-load / -X switch to _no_external_loader_programs=1;
 * Description variables beginning with '_' will not go into i: .
 * List variables in all i:* read from description file with "list 'vars|variables'".
 * Expansion of @variables and @# comments from description files.
 * The menu key in SDL mode shows a temporary mouse click actions menu.
 * Bugfix: description file reading was crashing due to wrong check.
 * Caption text of "_caption_over_image" takes at most half of the screen.
 * If _caption_over_image=3, image is possibly drawn below the caption.
 * The 'v' and 'S' keys now cause a redraw.
 * The description line can be of any length.
 * New configure option, defaulting to: --enable-paths-in-man; it generates man pages with configure specified paths (e.g. sysconfdir, docdir).
 * Fix: -s switch was broken.
 * Add a semicolon (;) to -C arguments if not present already.
 * Framebuffer console switch off while loading: configure with the 
   --enable-framebuffer-switch-while-loading switch to have it back.
 * Fix: configure would fail on --disable-aa and absent aalib.
 * Now configure has --enable-seek-magic by default. And is more verbose.
 * Command 'help' also shows key bindings, and give multiple answers if matching.
 * For each word following switch --help, an individual help message is shown.
 * Command 'goto' accepts multiple arguments; evaluating them until the first one triggering a jump.
 * Command goto {'-/'|'+/'}[C] jumps to a file based on character C (default 'S').
   If C is 's', to prev/next file with same directory name.
   If C is 'd', to prev/next file with directory name down the same hierarchy.
   If C is 'u', to prev/next file with directory name up the same hierarchy.
   If C is 'b', to prev/next file with same basename.
   If C is as above but uppercase, to the prev/next file not matching the criteria.
 * Accordingly, aliases 'next_file_dir_same', 'next_file_dir_other', 'next_file_dir_up',
   'next_file_dir_down', 'next_file_same_basename', 'prev_file_dir_same',
   'prev_file_dir_other', 'prev_file_dir_up' 'prev_file_dir_down' 'prev_file_same_basename'.
 * Fix: 'recording' command was not functioning properly.
 * Fix: don't pop back last command if "recording 'stop'" executed outside of recording mode.
 * Fix: won't clear recorded list if calling recording 'start' multiple times.
 * Specifying more than once any of -p -i - causes a warning.
 * New switch --verbose-interpreter to execute interpreter verbosely by setting adequately _debug_commands='ackC'.
 * Strings specified within single quotes have single quotes escaped, just as double quotes.
   So that e.g.: '\'hello\'' equals "'hello'" and "\"hello\"" equals '"hello"'.
 * Variable '_debug_commands' is now a string with several verbosity options.
 * Fix: misc fixes for --offset, e.g. avoiding probing for external loader programs.
 * Add --verbose-load option for verbose file loading.
 * -C '_seek_magic=..' probes whole range of specified signature when loading a file.
 * Fix in _seek_magic documentation.
 * Option --offset accepts numbers suffixed by one of K, M, and G for respectively kibi-, mebi-, and gibi- (2^10, 2^20 and 2^30) units.
 * Bugfix: --offset option was ignoring lower bytes-offset.
 * Fix: a check was missing in the PS decoder when reading from stdin.
 * Command 'pan' accepts '-' and '+' to jump to prev/next file if border is reached.
 * Command 'font' controls displayed font and scans font directories.
 * Keys '{' and '}' cycle through available consolefonts.
 * Variable _fbfont_magnify_factor scales text font at runtime.
 * Variable _fbfont_as_screen_fraction; if >0, font is scaled to exceed 1/_fbfont_as_screen_fraction of both width and height.  If _fbfont_as_screen_fraction<0, font scaling is fixed.
 * Keys '[' and ']' bound to new aliases "font_reduce" and "font_magnify".
 * Key '|' bound to new alias "toggle_font_auto_scale".
 * Switch -r {width:height} / --resolution {width:height} behaves as expected in SDL mode.
 * Variable _downscale_huge_at_load, if 1 (default), downscale automatically huge images at load time. To avoid loading images exceeding too much screen size.
 * Variable i:_buffered_in_tmpfile stores temporary decoding image filename, if any.
 * Internally load SVG files by invoking inkscape <file.svg> --without-gui --export-png <temp.png>. A file beginning with "<svg" is be considered an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).
 * Command 'scrollforward' skips a border if this is less than a fraction of the screen; this smoothes up documents reading. The fraction is one over '_scroll_skip_page_fraction', if >1; 1/16 if 1, no tolerance if <1.
 * Variable "_want_wm_mouse_ctrl" controls mouse click/movement behaviour in SDL mode.
 * Variable "_min_cached_images" is the minimum number of images to keep from eviction.
 * Commands  scale '<'  /  scale '>' shrinks/magnifies the image using cached mipmaps.
 * By default, show mouse cursor in full screen SDL mode.
 * Autocommand "PostInteractiveCommand" does not trigger anymore after 'quit' command.
 * In case of a CBZ,CBR,PDF,PS,DVI file, the fimgs script now uses '--autotop --autowidth'.
 * The fimgs script now probes for unrar-nonfree/rar/unrar-free (in this order).
 * Customize overlay text via variable '_caption_over_image_fmt'.
 * Command syntax 'goto {+|-}identifier[+]' (new) jumps to next file having a different value of i:identifier, also empty if without trailing `+'.
 * Command "limit '-set_union'" merges current limited list with the new one.
 * Command "limit '-merge'" merges current limited list with the new one.
 * Command "desc 'reload'" loads once again description files specified at the command line with --load-image-descriptions-file.
 * FIM only checks for filename duplicates if a sorting option is specified.
 * Switch -P/--text-reading fixed. Seems to be broken in version 0.5.
 * Command "color": "color 'negate'" and "color 'desaturate'" introduced.
 * Commands 'negate' and 'desaturate' deleted.
 * Command "color CVS" (CVS among 'protanopia', 'deuteranopia', 'tritanopia', 'p', 'd', 't') simulates a color vision deficiency; adding 'daltonize' applies a tentative color correction;  "color 'colorblind'" is short for "color 'deuteranopia'".
 * Command "color 'identity'": populate the image with 'RGB identity' pixels.
 * Introduce a "#!fim:/=dir" special description line to specify directory prepended to basename.
 * Introduce a "#!fim:\=dir" special description line to specify directory prepended to filepath.
 * Command limit '-list'      lists existing variables identifiers as set via 'desc'
 * Command limit '-list' 'id' lists existing values for instances of variable 'id' as set via 'desc'
 * Command "limit '~i' MINIDX[-MAXIDX]", with MINIDX and MAXIDX numbers (possibly with K as x 1000 multiplier) restricts filenames list to the specified interval.
 * Command "limit '~d'", limits to files having exact current file's modify date +- one day.
 * Command "limit '~z'" limits to files having same file size as the current.
 * Command "limit '~z' MINSIZE[-MAXSIZE]", with MINSIZE and MAXSIZE numbers with possibly K (x 1024) or M (x 1024 1024) multipliers, limits according to file size.
 * Command "limit '~d' MINTIME[-MAXTIME]", with MINTIME and MAXTIME numbers, limits files list according to file modify date (expressed as seconds since the epoch, see 'man 2 time').
 * Command "limit '~d' MINDATE[-MINDATE]", with MINDATE and MAXDATE dates as in DD/MM/YYYY, and after 1900.
 * Command "limit '-further' ..." makes 'limit' act on the current list, rather than on the full anew. 
 * Command "limit" uses new criteria:
   If invoked with '~!' it restricts to files with unique basename.
   If with '~=', to files with duplicate basename;
   if with '~^', to the first of the files with duplicate basename;
   if with '~$', to the last of the files with duplicate basename. 
 * Alias "unlimit" resets the limited list.
 * Add variable '_all_file_loaders': a space-separated list of hardcoded file loaders usable with '_file_loader'.
 * Switch -R/--recursive[=arg] has now an optional argument; overwrites (if set) or appends to (if beginning with + or |) the "_pushdir_re" variable (recursed filename extensions).
 * Introduce a "#!fim:+=" special description line to append to cached description.
 * Introduce a "#!fim:^=" special description line to prepend to cached description.
 * Introduce a "#!fim:!=" special description line to reset all variables of the cached namespace.
 * Command 'desc        "save"' functionality to save descriptions file data from the currently browsable images list.
 * Command 'desc "-append" "save"' works in append mode.
 * Command 'desc "-all" "save"' saves also all descriptions file variables.
 * Command 'desc "-nooverw" "save"' does not force overwrite.
 * To ease reproducible builds: imposing LC_ALL=C to $(YACC) and $(SORT), vim2html.pl reads SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
 * New switch --mark-from-image-descriptions-file: read file names from a description file and use them to mark current list files.
 * Introduced alphanumeric restriction in the descriptions shebang variables: must begin with underscore or alphabetic, continue with underscore or alphanumeric.
 * Keys '(' and ')' are now bound respectively to "goto '^p'" and "goto '$p'"; that is jump to first or last page.
 * Available symkeys are now documented in a section of man fimrc.
 * Switch -k --keysym-press <keysym> to simulate press of keysym at startup.
   Keysym can be prefixed by a repetition count number.
 * New switch  -/  <pattern> as short form of of -c /<pattern>.
 * New switch --// <pattern> as short form of of -c /<pattern> with _re_search_opts='f'.
 * Tehe space key (' ') is now assigned to 'scrollforward' (earlier was 's').
 * Introduced context prepend/append shebang syntax "#!fim:^=" and "#!fim:+=" in description files.
 * Switch --read-from-stdin-elds supports now the ASCII NUL terminator (via '').
 * Switch -V (--version) prints to stdout (not anymore to stderr).
 * The -B switch is now shorthand for --background-recursive.
 * If compiled in pre-C++11 flags, -B / --background-recursive behaves as -R.
 * Switch -S is now short form of --image-descriptions-file-separator (not anymore for --sanity-check).
 * Switch -D is now short form of --load-image-descriptions-file (not anymore for --dump-default-fimrc).
 * Switch -L/--read-from-file: read an image list from file (similarly to the - switch).
 * Now caching of mipmaps is on by default; can be turned off with new variable '_cache_control'.
 * Variable "_push_pushes_dirs"; if it is 2, also push hidden files and directories; that is, ones whose names begin with a dot (.).
 * configure --with-font-magnifying-factor=FACTOR controls text magnification by an integer factor.
   If FACTOR is positive, this value is hardcoded and cannot be changed at runtime.
   If FACTOR is negative, -FACTOR is default, but can be changed at runtime.
   If FACTOR is 0 (default) a default of 1 applies, and can be changed at runtime.
   This option is meant to be used on configurations with high resolutions and small consolefonts.
 * configure --with-tmpfile specifies a new temporary directory. 
 * configure tries to detect curses/ncurses.
 * Fix: mouse movement under SDL used to trigger unnecessary screen redraws.
 * Fix: the last used image is to be evicted from the cache as last, after possibly prefetched images.
 * Fix: in configure script, the regex_t check was unnecessarily broken.
 * Fix: ./configure --disable-pcx was not properly disabling PCX format support
 * With C++11 flags, --background-recursive loads images in the background recursively (experimental, unfinished).
 * Use variable "i:_file_load_time" to store the time taken to load the file and decode the image.
 * Use variable "_use_mipmaps=2" to compute the mipmaps faster, using every fourth source pixel.  This can be a good solution for speeding up large photographs scaling.
 * Description files beginning with "#!fim:desc" (of whatever extension) can now be loaded as they were normal image files.
 * Add switch --reverse to reverse the file list.
 * Add switch --sort-mtime to sort file list according to modification time.
 * Add switch --sort-fsize to sort file list according to file size.
 * Command "list 'sort_mtime'" to sort file list according to modification time.
 * Command "list 'sort_fsize'" to sort file list according to file size.
 * Command "list 'mark' {args}" accepts now exactly what "limit {args}" does.
 * Command syntax 'list "markall"' introduced.
 * Command syntax 'list "dumpmarked"' and 'list "unmarkall"' introduced.
 * Command 'list "swap"' introduced.
 * New '_lastgotodirection' variable, with the last file goto direction.
 * Key 'Enter' now marks and goes forward or back according to variable '_lastgotodirection'.
 * Fix: the largest mipmap was not always being used.
 * Fix: -lfl linkage is not really necessary: removed it.
 * Fix: support for PPM files with 2 bytes per sample.
 * Fix: a few more checks when reading PCX files.
 * Fix: documented that switch --sanity-check terminates the program, rather than continuing.
 * Fix: when stdint.h is available use uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t instead of non-portable __u8, __u16, __u32
 * Fix: compilation was broken without framebuffer (FIM_WITH_NO_FRAMEBUFFER)
 * Fix: cleaned up the internal keysyms initialization code.
 * Fix: removed obsolete documentation for the "window" command, now disabled.
 * Bugfix: improve GIF error handling.
 * Bugfix: on certain framebuffer configurations part of the screen was not being redrawn.
 * Bugfix: conversion from external program was vulnerable to failure due to a missing check.
 * Bugfix: avoiding data corruption when handling %k expando.
 * Bugfix: repeating "recording 'repeat_last'" (default '.' key) by prepending a number now works.
 * Fix: configure uses `sdl-config --static-lib`.
