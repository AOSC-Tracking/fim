# (r746*)
 * -R / --recursive switch to turn on recursive push of command line specified directories

# (r644,r651*) (undocumented) r676)
 * status bar customizable with _display_status_fmt and _info_fmt_str, which can be
   controlled by the use of special image variable specifiers ('expandos'):
    "%T" expando to get (and display) total memory used by the program

   key and the _lastfileindex variable

   the i:_comment values of each loaded image file and set _caption_over_image=2

   "#!fim:var="      (to unset i:var=value on all all the files following)
   "filename #!fim:=" (to i:_comment from the value read last)
   "filename #!fim:+comment" (similar, but will append the new comment)
