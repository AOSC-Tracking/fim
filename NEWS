About:
FIM (Fbi IMproved) aims to be a highly customizable and scriptable image viewer targeted at the users who are confortable with software like the Vim text editor or the Mutt mail user agent. It is based on the Fbi image viewer and works in the Linux framebuffer console (it is not an X program). It features the ability to filter the list of images with regular expressions, Vim-like autocommands, command line autocompletion and history, completely customizable key bindings, external/internal scriptability, and much more.
