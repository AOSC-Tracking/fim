                Version 0.5-rc4 (in progress)

 * documentation fixes.
 * bugfix: description file reading could crash due to wrong check.
 * bugfix: expando mechanism crashed on long comment strings.

                Version 0.5-rc3

 * fix: mouse movement under SDL used to trigger unnecessary screen redraws.
 * bugfix: on certain framebuffer configurations part of the screen would not be redrawn.
 * bugfix: conversion from external program was vulnerable to failure due to missing check.
 * fix: gif error handling could have led to NULL pointer usage.
 * fix: the largest mipmap was not always being used.
 * fix: -lfl linkage is not really necessary: removed it.
 * fix: support for PPM files with 2 bytes per sample.
 * fix: configure script regex_t check was unnecessarily broken
 * fix: was likely using uninitialized data in Image()
 * fix: a few more checks when reading PCX files
 * bugfix: a function in AADevice was missing return value
 * documented the %k expando for _info_fmt_str and bugfix (avoiding data corruption when handling %k)
 * to ease reproducible builds: imposing LC_ALL=C to $(YACC) and $(SORT), vim2html.pl reads SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
 * fix: when stdint.h is available use uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t instead of non-portable __u8, __u16, __u32
 * fix: ./configure --disable-pcx was not properly disabling PCX format support
 * fix: compilation was broken without framebuffer (FIM_WITH_NO_FRAMEBUFFER)
 * fix: compilation was broken without FIM_WITH_LIBSDL configured in
 * fix: with _re_search_opts='f' the in-descriptions search was broken
 * fix: removed obsolete documentation for the "window" command, now disabled
 * bugfix: repeating "recording 'repeat_last'" (default '.' key) by prepending a number now works
 * fix: cleaned up the internal keysyms initialization code
 * fix: lastly used image will be erased at last, after eventually prefetched images.
 * fix: configure will try to detect curses/ncurses.
 * fix: configure will use `sdl-config --static-lib`'.
 * fix: a check was missing in the PS decoder when reading from stdin.
 * bugfix: --offset option was ignoring lower bytes-offset.
 * fix in _seek_magic and documentation.
 * fix: in --offset mode, avoiding probing for external loader programs, handling of larger offsets.
 * fix: 'recording' command non functioning properly.
 * fix: configure would fail on --disable-aa and absent aalib.
 * fix: -s switch was broken.

                Version 0.5-rc2

 * configure will autodetect and turn aalib on by default
 * fix: will emit more precise diagnostics on unsupported device string
 * fix: adjusted man pages for roff cleanliness
 * fix: typos fixed in the documentation

                Version 0.5-rc1

 * fix: enabled concurrent make, e.g.: make -j 4
 * bug workaround: had no console scroll if no command executed on PostInteractiveCommand
 * fix: some systems don't have sys_errlist: using strerror there
 * fix: corrected the quiet mode (-q) to be quieter
 * fix: no zlib.h build time dependency (this will be reintroduced in the future)

                Version 0.5-rc0

 * -R / --recursive switch to turn on recursive push of command line specified directories
 * added --sort and --sort-basename to sort the images list
 * introduced mipmap mechanism (_use_mipmaps) for faster display/scaling of images
 * status bar customizable with _display_status_fmt and _info_fmt_str, which can be
   controlled by the use of special image variable specifiers ('expandos'):
    "%T" expando to get (and display) total memory used by the program 
    "%C" expando to get (and display) file/memory usage by image cache
    "%M" expando to get (and display) memory used by the current (displayed) image
    "%c" expando to get (and display) centering information
    "%m" expando to get (and display) current image mipmap occupation information
    "%k" expando to get (and display) current image i:_comment value
    "%?PRE?VAR?POST?" expando to get (and display) "PRE".i:VAR."POST"
    ...
 * search (and jump) on image descriptions via 'goto' and key '/'
 * when repeating search with 'repeat_last', will use last direction
 * '?' key is now assigned to backward search (goto '-//')
 * default 'C-p' key is now assigned to repeat last backward search (goto '-//')
 * image cache will remember alignment within viewport
 * jump back and forth from the last viewed image with the ' (single quote aka apostrophe)
   key and the _lastfileindex variable
 * added --load-image-descriptions-file (equivalent to 'desc' 'load') to populate 
   the i:_comment values of each loaded image file and set _caption_over_image=2
   (with it added also --image-descriptions-file-separator)
 * added the 'desc "load"' command to load a textual files comments description file
 * introduced a 'limit' command, with comment, file name, or marked file criteria
 * the '`' key is bound to toggle limit'ing to the marked files list
 * introduced 'list "mark"' and 'list "unmark"' syntax styled as 'limit'
 * load i:_comment and i:var from description file, with forms:
   "filename comment" (to i:_comment),
   "#!fim:var=value" (to   set i:var=value on all all the files following)
   "#!fim:var="      (to unset i:var=value on all all the files following)
   "filename #!fim:=" (to i:_comment from the value read last)
   "filename #!fim:+comment" (similar, but will append the new comment)
   "filename #!fim:^comment" (similar, but will prepend the new comment)
   "filename #!fim:s/f/t" (similar, but replace string f with string t)
 * EXIF tags will be read with libexif and become i:EXIF_-prefixed variables
 * if _want_exif_orientation is set, images will be reoriented according to EXIF
   metadata (i:__exif_orientation, i:__exif_mirrored, i:__exif_flipped).
 * the 'help' command will search also in fim command options
 * will optionally use C++11 constructs with ./configure --enable-cxx11 (no user level impact)
 * scaling image code faster (thanks to __restrict__ pointers)
 * customizable SDL window caption line with _want_wm_caption_status
 * BMP format support is now optional
 * PCX format support (optional)
 * changed meaning of variable _ignorecase: now it affects autocommands
 * introduced variable _re_search_opts affecting regexp-based search
 * default key 'r' is bound to 'rotate90', key 'R' to 'rotate270'
 * can be invoked without stdin; e.g. from an X menu
 * added "display 'resize'" to resize the SDL window, eventually to image size
 * default SDL mode is windowed now
 * by default, the 'C-w' key will resize the SDL window to the original image size
 * by default, the 'W' key will resize the SDL window to the image size,
   and added an --autowindow switch to adapt window size to picture size
 * the 'help' command will search in help items if argument starts with /
 * special variable i:* expanding to all the variable name/value pairs of the current image
 * opening image files in archives (e.g. CBZ,CBR,RAR,TAR,TGZ,TBZ,7Z,ISO,...)
   with libarchive (experimental)
 * JPEG-2000 file support via JasPer (experimental)
 * added a ':- INTEGER' syntax, so one can specify the file in the list counting from the end
 * added an _archive_files variable to specify which file name types specify archives
 * added a 'list "pushdirr"' command, working like "pushdir" but recursively
 * the _fbfont variable will contain the current console font file string
 * mirror/flip are now being applied with respect to the viewport borders
 * stat() checking of files on load can be disabled with _push_checks
 * added --no-stat-push to set _push_checks=0 before initialization
 * added the _caption_over_image variable (which is 0 unless --load-image-descriptions-file)
 * 'Pause' and 'Menu' keys are now available in SDL (-o sdl) mode
 * added  'list' 'marked'  to show the list of marked files
 * key 'Del' bound to pop (delete) the current image from the list
 * i:_file loader will store the used loader string
 * switch --offset accepts a range now (using the new _open_offset_retry variable)
 * if an image has been opened with an offset, i:_open_offset will be set accordingly
 * variable i:pagecount is now replaced by i:pages
 * put aside (disabled) the v: b: and w: namespaces until they make more sense
 * panning on mouse movement in SDL mode
 * `make fim' goal has been deleted
 * changed librsb library detection: now it's e.g.:
   LIBS="`librsb-config  --ldflags --extra_libs` " CXXFLAGS="`librsb-config --cflags ` \
   ./configure --enable-matrices-rendering
 * bugfix: in some situations fim -o fb was not clearing the screen before drawing the image
