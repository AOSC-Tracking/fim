This file is a melange of ideas aimed towards further development.
If you are interested into FIM internals, philosophy, and evolution, you
are welcome to read this file.
Of course, the BUGS file is a source of constant inspiration for further work, too.

If you intend to learn about FIM, please read the program documentation  in the
 doc directory.

	Current development directions
20070903	these features are currently going to be worked in the near future:
			- the combined window+viewport subsystem
			- arbitrary long key sequence bindings (mutt-like)
			- shortcuts algebra for commands
			- parameter passing to commands 
			- variables scoped inside viewport (v:), window (w:), image (i: or l:), global (g:), script (s:)
			- (to study) lookup tables to string to integer token conversion of variable names 
			  (to gain speedup and increase variables impact)
			- (to study) active variables - variables triggering actions
			- vim like 'set', 'let', 'unlet' commands..
20070812	examine fbi's weak points like http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/2203/ and fix them in Fim, if present.
20070812	study the benefits of integration with libraries like:
		DirectFB : for a simpler driver and display mechanism
		MXK : for fancy input devices and capabilities
		...
20070812	integrate the freshmeat-announce(freshmeat-submit script
20070811	to familiarize with AC_PREREQ and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to a rudimentary dependency check for maintainers
20070810	the time is right for a massive fimrc rewrite and example scripts:
		you could also write a little cookbook in the documentation, 
		with examples like :
			find -name *jpg | fim - | xargs convert -0 
20070613	sync documentation, website and the whole with VERSION :)
20070517	automated inline - to txt documentation is a future issue
20070517	an useless, optional grid, under or over the image
20070514	There is a growing need to document the target audience of this
	software and its purposes.
	Then:
	- integrate with external libraries for image analysis (like ANIMAL)
	- integrate with some scripting language (perl, python)
20070417	It has come the time to decide the future developments of Fim.
	A lot of doubts arose. Here they are:
	- integration of the command line completion with the lexer/parser, to
	  gain consistency
	- introduction of a windowing system (yes, a wierd thing), but this
	  would imply a prior reordering of the underlying Fbi code
	- decisions about the nature of the language:
	  - should the variables be accessed like Bash,Perl, or C?
	  - should strings exist?
	  - should arrays exist ?
	  - should types exist ?
	  - should boolean options exist (like in Vim's paste/nopaste) ?
	  - should multi (quad/..) options exist (like in Mutt) ?
	- could it be nice to attach options set to an image/browser (e.g.: 
	  autowidth in only a window in a multiwindow scenario )?
	- once the core of Fim is clean enough, would it be the moment of porting 
	  it to X and/or aalib/cacalib/directFB ?
	- integration with external libraries/scripts/etc.. ?

	These issues need reflection and study of the practical and theoretical
	advantages/possibilities/limitations of the alternatives.
	Meanwhile, the current development effort will be focused on enhancing
	the existing code, possibly not adding features but enhancing the code
	structure and converting the odd Fbi code in elegant, or possibly more
	optimized, (especially the hacked, critical parts concerning mirroring
	and flipping! ) Fim code.
	- it would be nice to use autoconf and/or automake to automate builds..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimization:
20070418	Got ~400% speedup on image display thanks to trivial changes in
	the drawing code : memset and memcpy instead of assignations, and a less
	trivial change by swapping RGB channels on loading time instead that on
	drawing time. The analysis was made with the gprof profiler, nicely.

Maybe one day me or some contributor will read 
	http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/ScOut/Publications/PaperInfo/sf05.html
	or
Example 4.14 of the Intel Architecture SW Manual Optimization explains how to
and find some useful idea.
use PSHUFLW,PSHUFW,PSHUFD to reverse contiguous words in registers.

This file is often outdated : FIM is far better than it seems here :)

Please read the FIM.TXT file and the fimrc template to discover nice FIM features.

	OPEN   BUGS:
20070307	It is not clear which key terminates always loops.
20070307	config file parsing is still to be checked throughly
20070129	control 4 crashes the prog ... why ? :)

	MISSING SMALL FIXES:
20070312	fix dumping of recording in some file!	
20070125	fix the string vs variable problem
20070128	fixa l'argument passing che e' problematico! e fixa i commenti!
20070129	fix the KEY binding
20070211	flex and bison parts should be rewritten
20070212	fix the command evaluation
20070303	fix rar and zip dependencies in Makefiles and such for fimgs.sh
20070303	see if while-nesting is a real danger or not!
20070303	update the while construct documentation and fix the while command execution bugs 
20070303	add an interface for setting exitBinding (now Enter!)
20070306	primary goals : documentation and warning messages!

20070303
		load cfg, save cfg

20070401	better variable handling : boolean variables, conversion, 'no' prefixing,
		completion fitting the language rules..

	DATES:
20061223	inception
20070202	stress testing (1000+d-) gave : CommandConsole.cpp:577: "pipe error"
20070204	make stricter the policy of recording (only aliases and/or lines.complete the time behaviour
	IDEAS

20070216	eliminate image tearing by studying the framebuffer device
		repeat_last N ?!
	TIPS
20070302	use __FUNCTION__ : is not ANSI, but GCC
20070303	realtime clock... -lrt cannot  be used with FIM
