This file is often outdated : FIM is far better than it seems here :)

Please read the FIM.TXT file and the fimrc template to discover nice FIM features.

	OPEN   BUGS:
20070307	It is not clear which key terminates always loops.
20070307	config file parsing is still to be checked throughly
20070129	control 4 crashes the prog ... why ? :)
20070303	problems when panning during a loop

	MISSING SMALL FIXES:
20070312	fix dumping of recording in some file!	
20070125	fix the string vs variable problem
20070128	fixa l'argument passing che e' problematico! e fixa i commenti!
20070129	fix the KEY binding
20070211	flex and bison parts should be rewritten
20070212	fix the command evaluation
20070303	fix rar and zip dependencies in Makefiles and such for fbgs.sh
20070303	see if while-nesting is a real danger or not!
20070303	update the while construct documentation and fix the while command execution bugs 
20070303	add an interface for setting exitBinding (now Enter!)
20070306	primary goals : documentation and warning messages!
20070306	add a way to dump to stdout the default configuration file contents
20070210	fix properly the file parser (comments problems!) and max script filelength limit
20070210	add an interface to modify key bindings and keycode bindings.
20070401	variables : $VARNAME or $(VARNAME) or VARNAME ?

	SCIENCE FICTION WISHED ADD-ONS:
20070307	someday: to integrate with a speech recognizer for command issuing
20070323	image understanding language - based pattern selection
20070401	?= /semanticexp/ operator

	ADD:
20070401	~= /regexp/ operator
20070401	<=,>= operators
20070401	find's -exec '{}' ';' -like predicate syntax
20070216	create a decent installer
20070129	dump internal commands function
20070125	add pipe to other commands and exec and system (screenshot with fbgrab, for example)
20070126	better key printout to ease configuration
20070128	add support for command renaming with checks...
20070130	proper signal handing for while cycle interruption..
20070201	cwd,ls,pwd,stat,file...
20070201	--norc, --rc= mechanisms
20070208	? rewrite the parser in full C++ or traditional, clean C
20070201	asymmetric scaling

	MISC IDEAS :
20070303
		load cfg, save cfg
		flip=yes|no
		scale=i|i:i|:i|i:|
		fit  =width|height|none|image|min|max
		center=t|b|l|r|tl|tr|bl|br|center
		orientation=90|... [cw|ccw] | flip
		mirror=yes|no
		persistent_options= word*|'*'
		transient_options = word*
		logfile=...
		debugfile=..
		cwd=word
		negative=..
		interpolator=..
		options_style=stacked|trasient|permanent_save	
			function : 
		[n]%[r|l]
		+|-n[%]
20070401	better variable handling : boolean variables, conversion, 'no' prefixing,
		completion fitting the language rules..

	DATES:
20061223	inception
20070202	come trattare gli $ nelle stringhe ?
20070202	stress testing (1000+d-) gave : CommandConsole.cpp:577: "pipe error"
20070202	aspect ratio expansion and pan speed factors..
20070204	make stricter the policy of recording (only aliases and/or lines.complete the time behaviour
20070210	eliminate the fresh variable from the config?
20070216	eliminate image tearing by studying the framebuffer device
	TIPS
20070302	use __FUNCTION__ : is not ANSI, but GCC
20070303	realtime clock... -lrt cannot  be used with FIM
