2008-05-08 18:34  dezperado

	* : fim-0.3-alpha introduced a problem with the prompt display (it
	  missed).
	  fixed his and corrected the status line printing code.

2008-05-07 14:15  dezperado

	* : Various fixes to contrast -Wall warning messages. Remains a
	  bogus warning on FontServer.h.
	  Tested with -pedantic flags too, and the following are the files
	  which won't compile:
	  lex.yy.cc FbiStuff.cpp FbiStuffPpm.cpp FbiStuffBmp.cpp
	  FbiStuffGif.cpp FbiStuffTiff.cpp FbiStuffPng.cpp
	  The main reason for this being the F*pp files being the quick C++
	  porting of C fbi stuff
	  ( error: ISO C++ does not allow designated initializers ).

2008-05-06 20:42  dezperado

	* : This version will be released as fim-0.3-alpha.

2008-05-06 20:41  dezperado

	* : Some -Wall and -pedantic oriented corrections, but much more is
	  needed to adapt fbi's C code to correct C++.
	  Fixed the signed-dist rules in Makefile.am.

	  Added a fix to compile when readline is linked to the curses
	  library.

2008-05-05 07:34  dezperado

	* : Completed the aalib support.
	  Started working on a libcaca (Coloured Ascii Art) driver
	  Implemented a DummyDisplayDevice class.
	  Discovered weird bugs seemingly related to aalib+screen :)
	  Added to svn the scripts/benchmark.sh script.

2008-05-03 16:18  dezperado

	* : Fixed the negation '!' operator behaviour and added tests to
	  sanity.fim.
	  Implemented a regular expressions matching operator '=~'.
	  Now unquoted strings can be passed as arguments to fim commands,
	  as long as they are quite simple and resemble a simple file name
	  (FILE_PATH token).
	  Implemented the --write-scriptout (-W) option and fixed some
	  broken recording issues.
	  fim -V will print repository version, too .
	  Corrected incorrect regcomp() calls, which triggered error only
	  on -1 return values.
	  Corrected a bit the rc file sequence: ~.fimrc first, /etc/fimrc
	  otherwise.
	  New default key bindings for window handlings.
	  Updated man page and FIM.TXT.
	  Corrected a {;; } related problem for the FIM_ITERATED_COMMANDS
	  functionality.

	  hosts willing to test fim building.

2008-04-14 18:48  dezperado

	* : Big optimizations and speedup in magnifying pictures through
	  loop unrollings, and a 20% improvement in dithering handling, in
	  convert_line().

2008-04-11 19:56  dezperado

	* : Unrolled the magnifying loop in op_resize_work : now we magnify
	  50% and more faster.

	  (like fimscan.sh).

2008-03-25 18:08  dezperado

	* : Some less extern references.
	  Improved a little the image magnification code: better for big
	  magnifications.

	* : Implemented the -i option to read an image file via standard
	  input.
	  Implemented the -p option to read a fim script via standard

	  symbol.
	  Fixed a little the -f option.
	  Documented the changes in the fim man page and updated the

	  Renamed some options in configure.ac.

2008-03-13 18:07  dezperado

	* : A new debug (textual) console is under building.
	  This one will bring scroll functionalities and much more.

2008-02-20 17:50  dezperado

2008-02-19 17:13  dezperado

	* : Worked on cleaning up the parser.

	  Marked conflicting parser rules.

2008-02-18 15:23  dezperado

	* : Updated string and float representations and operators.
	  Removed some parser conflicts.
	  Octal and hexadecimal integer constant representation now
	  supported.
	  Moved int ex() to Var ex() for this.
	  Changed the policy of -E (no files should be in list prior to
	  early Fim exit).
	  Fixed some -Wall warning-triggering stuff.
	  Asymmetric scaling aliases introduced.
	  Directory read feature introduced
	  (FIM_READ_DIRS,FIM_RECURSIVE_DIRS) (though disabld by default).
	  Random numbers pour out of /dev/urandom now.
	  Regexp substitution and matching into the string class
	  introduced.

	  Introduced FIM_SKIP_KNOWN_FILETYPES feature (disabled by
	  default).
	  Introduced sanity check script : scripts/tests/sanity.fim.
	  Retouched man pages and docs (which still awaits some
	  formalization).

2008-02-14 15:58  dezperado

	* : Added and documented a functionality for numerically specifying
	  the iteration of a command, in interactive mode.
	  Documented the external converting programs compatibility.
	  Set the ChangeLog as the subversion log.

2008-02-03 18:46  dezperado

	* : Added const specifiers to many methods in many classes, and
	  adopted more typedefs.
	  Added (non native) support to : dia files, xfig files, gimp (xcf)
	  files, svg files.
	  Updated configure.ac to fine tune these new functionalities.

2008-02-02 13:39  dezperado

	* : Reduced further the impact of global variables, encapsulating
	  more functions in the right classes.
	  Namespace::GetIntVariable is now const.
	  The make process doesn't show defined symbols, as these are
	  pushed in config.h (we will use autoheader, now on).
	  Removed extern.h : no need to use it.

2008-01-31 16:39  dezperado

	* : Moved readline related stuff to readline.cpp.
	  Packing the most into the fim namespace.
	  Introduced a FimInstance class.
	  Moved general purpose functions from fim.cpp to common.cpp.
	  Generally, minimized references to global variables.

2008-01-27 13:35  dezperado

	* : Massive code removal : the adapted fbi code now is 'master'.
	  So, the FIM_NO_FBI macro was removed, too.
	  Now fim works by default under screen (with some problems, of
	  course), unless compiled with --disable-screen.
	  Fixed a typo in (the adapted) setpixel4 causing a bug.

2008-01-26 16:46  dezperado

	* : Massive code adaption : (nearly) original fbi code in the
	  src/fbi_src/ directory was adapted to C++ and moved in .cpp files
	  in the src/ directory.
	  In this way, further code evolution should proceed more smoothly,
	  as some class for framebuffer stuff and such will be created.
	  Implementation of new functionalities should be less error-prone
	  than now, although much work is going to be done in reorganizing
	  in the best way all the existing fbi code in fim first.
	  The FIM_NO_FBI symbol, now default in Makefile.am, inhibits the
	  fbi_src/ code being compiled via the preprocessor.
	  Fixed a console cluttering issue (a 'wild' printf() of the
	  configuration file).
	  Also subordinated some wild stderr-fprintf to a debug condition.

2008-01-03 20:03  dezperado

2007-10-10 13:37  dezperado

	* : The terrible bugs haunting Fim were just bad programming
	  practice :
	  memcpy(this,... in a constructor !
	  Cache seems sane, but still should be validated thoroughly.
	  It is time to think about the vim-like variable policies.

2007-10-10 00:10  dezperado

	* : Right now the cache is again disabled, and again there are bad
	  bugs.
	  I trigger them with such simple statements as
	  '4next;split;7next'.

	* : AUTHORS notice update and helpful documentation corrections by
	  iam.

2007-10-06 12:33  dezperado

	* : Introduced namespaces for variables: {b,i,g,v,w}.
	  The coherence, policy, and mechanisms to react to variable
	  changes
	  or update them are still to define (just like mechanisms for
	  namespace
	  inheritance among window objects...).

2007-10-05 22:04  dezperado

	* : Added the --etc-fimrc option.
	  Updated a little the BUGS and TODO files.

2007-09-19 11:05  dezperado

	* : Fixed the 'rescale bug' : it was a Viewport::display() bug :
	  bad alignment values (left,top,..) for big new images.

2007-09-18 23:22  dezperado

	* : Updated the Free Software Foundation address in COPYING and
	  fim.man.

2007-09-04 19:53  dezperado

	* : Migrated lots of code from Image to Viewport, on the way to
	  Viewport concept expansion.
	  Browser impacted and generalized a small epsilon.

2007-09-03 22:12  dezperado

	* : Fixed (rather patched) a bug regarding console output.

2007-09-03 21:30  dezperado

2007-07-30 21:06  dezperado

	* : Now the --no-framebuffer runtime option will select a debug run
	  with the
	  framebuffer device 'disabled'; that is, a limited fim run, for
	  debug purposes.
	  In fact, i am working on the dynamical length string handling.
	  Buggy for now.

	  mechanisms,
	  for speeding up large image browsing.
	  Now there is the need of implementing some memory statistics.

2007-07-08 14:40  dezperado

	* : Implemented the FIM_BOZ_PATCH macro, which disables lots of
	  actions
	  in the framebuffer initialization code, allowing the of fim under
	  the screen utility, at a cost of some little problems.
	  Investigations will continue there.
	  Enriched the configure script.

2007-06-30 01:38  dezperado

	* : Fixed a problem with small flex versions incompatibilities.
	  What a hassle!
	  Now -lfl is reintroduced. This could be a problem on some

	  The ! operator allows system command execution and results
	  display.
	  'cd','pwd' commands introduced (still partially inconsistent
	  'cd').

2007-05-15 01:43  dezperado

	* : Corrected most shift/reduce conflicts in the parser. One
	  remains.
	  Variable concatenation (with evaluation) is possible now, but
	  still experimental.

	  Implemented top_align, bottom_align commands.

2007-04-25 12:59  dezperado

	* : Dramatic speed improvement on image drawing (convert_line) by
	  swapping
	  RGB bytes on load time rather than when drawing. Now the drawing
	  code itself
	  draws many times faster than before.
	  Now the profiler indicates the image resize code as the slower
	  one, and this
	  will be a wicked beast, maybe :). Here is the gang of the new top
	  seven :
	  % cumulative self self total
	  time seconds seconds calls ms/call ms/call name
	  92.98 1.06 1.06 8157 0.13 0.13 op_resize_work

	  0.88 1.13 0.01 59 0.17 0.17
	  fim::CommandConsole::autocmd_exec(fim::string const&, fim::string

	  0.00 1.14 0.00 96651 0.00 0.00 setpixel3
	  Thorough testing with non 24 bit modes has still to come.

	* : Added some thoughts about future development efforts to the
	  TODO file.
	  Gained a 20% global speedup (according to gprof) employing memset
	  in fb_memset and clear_line.
	  Now (according to gprof) most of the time is consumed in : ~50%
	  in convert_line and ~20% in op_resize_work.
